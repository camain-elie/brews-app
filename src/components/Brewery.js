                                <p>This brewery company is an independent craft brewery located in Beer City in the Hoppy District.
                                    It is Beer City's first brewery, and also the oldest brewery of the country !</p>
                                <p>We produce around 1200 gallons a month, although we sell onlly about half of that. The second half seems to always be missing, due to... hum... mysterious reasons ðŸ˜‡</p>
                                <p>I will have to be honnest here, my imagination just ran out and I am getting fed up of writting so... I hope nobody is reading this far.
                                    Cause this won't get any more interesting. And I am sure you have better things to do. Won't you go clean the dishes, or make some fantastic projects ?
                                    Really, instead of reading all of that, you could have accomplished your dreams.</p>
                                <p>Well maybe not, but still. Go play the piano, write a poem or better, enjoy a beer in the company of your beloved friends ! What ? Don't have any friends ?
                                    Hum... lucky you ! I happen to just have a few beers in the fridge and I'm probably only a few thousands miles away, so... come over dude ! In the meanwhile,
                                    have a great day ! See ya !
